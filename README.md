# DD2424-covid-xray-project

This repo is the home of the project "Detection of COVID-19 Based on Radiography Images and Identification of the Responsible Regions." It is the group project for the course DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science, given in spring 2020.

The work would not have been possible if it was not for the dataset we used - COVIDx. This dataset is publically avaliable here - https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net. The version used here is COVIDx2, published on 15 April.

It is important to be noted that any labaling by our model is not a diaginosis.
